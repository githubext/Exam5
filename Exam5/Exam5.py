#1) Create and Assign a type float variable called fltOne the value 2 (3)


#2) Create and Assign a type float variable called fltTwo the value 200 (3)


#3) Create and Assign a type float variable called fltThree with the product of fltTwo and fltOne(3)


#4) Create and assign a variable called stringOne with the value "The product of fltOne and fltTwo = "(3)


#5) On the console, output stringOne and fltThree (in that order) (3)

#6) increment fltOne  (3)

#7)  prompt the user to provide an input to fltFour with the message "Please provide another number for fltFour". Ensure a float is given (4)

#8) on the console, output the product of fltThree and floatFour with a suitable message showing this is task 8(3)

#9) Prompt the user to say a greeting. Apply a decision based on the greeting inputted. 
#If the user types "Hello", respond by outputting to the console "Good greeting"
#If the user types "hello", respond by outputting to the console "Good greeting, but capital letter?"
#If the user types anything else, respond by outputting to the console "Not what I was expecting" (10)


#10) create a list called listOfStrings (4)


# 11 part a) populate the list with the following strings:
# Hello, Hi, Salut, Good Day, Bon Dia, Howdy
# Output the list to the console with a suitable message(4)


#11 part b) create a for loop to iterate through the above list and 
#output to the console the length of the shortest greeting (12)
#for example, for the above list, the output should be 2

#12) Sir Isaac Newton created the three laws of motion. The second of these laws 
#links force with mass and acceleration. The formula is as follows:
#Force = Mass x Acceleration. Force is measured in Newtons
#Write a function called calcForc which takes two arguments (Mass and Acceleration) and returns
# the product of these two arguments
#Therefore a call of calcForce(500,2) should returnn 1000
#Give the default acceleration as 9.81 (Gravity). a call of calcForce(100) should return 981
#(10)


#13) create a function called caseChanger which takes a string argument written all in lower case
#It will return the word with all letters in the same case except 'a' which it will convert to 'A'
#For example, caseChanger("case") would return "cAse". another example caseChanger("casE") returns "cAsE"
#Write a suitable print statement to show this working (15)

#14 a) Create a list that represents a set of cars. The list should contain the following
#cars: Focus,Up,Golf,Robin,Fiesta,Astra,Tiguan,Leaf (4 marks)

#14 part b) use a method to order the cars so that they are in alphabetical order (3 marks)
#print this to the screen


#15) Populate a tuple that represents top speeds of the cars (4 marks)
#These are the respective speeds for the alphabetically ordered car list
# 120,100,125,126,78,40,105,93


#16) Dictionary question (9 marks)
#create a dictionary which joins the cars with their corresponding speed. 
#write a suitable print statement which prints all cars, with their speeds
